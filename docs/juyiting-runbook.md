# Juyi Hall Runbook

This is the short working guide for future 聚义厅/Juyi Hall iterations. Use `docs/juyiting-feature-guide.md` for deeper flow details.
For map masking, prop depth, occluder assets, and future map expansion, use `docs/juyiting-occlusion-system-design.md`.
For the serial implementation order and DeepSeek/GPT Agent allocation, use `docs/juyiting-occlusion-system-execution-plan.md`.
For the current GPT multimodal visual baseline verdict and required contact sheets, use `docs/juyiting-occlusion-visual-review-v0.md`.

## Current Data Boundaries

- `mapAgents` is for the map stage and comes from `GET /agent/map`.
- `agents` is for roster, recommendations, ability options, and selected-agent detail surfaces.
- Roster filtering calls `POST /agent/roster`.
- Task search calls `POST /agent/tasks/search`.
- Task assignment calls `POST /agent/tasks/{taskId}/assign` with an explicit `agentId`.
- 宋江首领自动协同 uses `GET /agent/capabilities`, `POST /agent/tasks/{taskId}/recommend`, and `POST /agent/tasks/{taskId}/auto-assign`; recommendation results should remain explainable and manual assignment remains the fallback.
- Juyi Hall chat sends through `POST /chat/stream` and receives events from `GET /chat/conversation/events`.
- 招贤令 binding calls `POST /agent/personas/{personaCode}/bind`; `mode=server` provisions `/home/isp/apps/codex-ws-agent` and `/home/isp/hosts/cyf/agent-clients/{agent}`, while `mode=local` returns user-side install/config guidance.
- Do not use `/agent/active` for Juyi Hall.

## Role Portrait Rules

- Role matching is done by `portraitRole(agent)` in `useWaterMarginRoles.js`.
- Role metadata is in `portraitRoles` inside `web/src/constants/juyiting.js`, covering all 108 Water Margin prototypes with rank, star name, name, nickname, palette, and motif.
- If an agent has `agent.avatar`, that wins.
- Per-role assets live under `web/public/juyiting-portraits/`: all 108 prototypes have static SVG fallback portraits, plus realistic PNG portraits as 4 single images and 26 `water-margin-atlas-*.png` 2x2 sheets. Do not place static files under `web/public/juyiting/`, which collides with the `/juyiting` route.
- `useWaterMarginRoles.js` prefers explicit agent avatars, then custom generated SVG for `visualConfig`, then realistic PNG/atlas portraits for matched roles, and finally the static SVG fallback. Do not reintroduce the old 3x2 sprite-grid fallback.

## UI Invariants

- Map filtering and roster filtering are separate. Changing roster status should not remove map agents.
- `visibleAgents` should derive from `mapAgents`, not from roster state.
- Bounty assignment should receive the target agent from the clicked row or explicit action payload.
- Chat context should preserve selected agent, mentioned agents, selected task, and `scene: 'juyiting'` metadata.
- Keep map controls and fixed-format UI elements dimensionally stable to avoid layout jumps.

## Backend Areas

| Concern | Backend path |
| --- | --- |
| Agent runtime/persona/task meta | `api/agent/` |
| Juyi Hall conversation type and messages | `api/chat/` |
| General task domain | `api/task/` |

Start backend searches with:

```bash
rg -n "map|roster|tasks/search|assign|AgentRuntime|AgentPersona" api/agent
rg -n "juyiting|conversation_type|chat/stream|conversation/events" api/chat
```

## Verification Checklist

For source changes under `web/`:

```bash
cd web && npm run build
```

For behavior changes, also inspect relevant tests under `web/tests/`. Useful search:

```bash
rg -n "juyiting|JuyiHall|agent/map|agent/roster|agent/active|assign-task" web/tests web/src
```

For visual changes, start the dev server when useful:

```bash
cd web && npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

## Documentation Hygiene

- Keep this runbook short and operational.
- Put detailed flow diagrams or long explanations in `docs/juyiting-feature-guide.md`.
- When fixing a repeated issue, add one sentence here under the relevant section so future sessions do not rediscover it.
